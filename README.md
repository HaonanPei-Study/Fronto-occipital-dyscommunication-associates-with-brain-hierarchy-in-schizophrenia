Code availability:
The preprocessing of the fMRI data and permutation test with a threshold-free cluster enhancement were conducted using DPABI (https://rfmri.org/DPABI).
The preprocessing of the EEG data was conducted using EEGLAB (https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/).
Cortical Gradients were calculated using the BrainSpace toolbox (https://github.com/MICA-MNI/BrainSpace/releases).
The codes to calculate gradient eccentricity are available on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/48tfa/).
The implementation of cortical traveling waves is based on open-source code (https://github.com/artipago).
The PROCESS macro for the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences was used to perform the moderation analysis.
Linear mixed-effects models were constructed using the lme4 package in R 4.3.1.
The implementation of spatial autocorrelation-preserving permutation tests is based on ENIGMA toolbox (https://enigma-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
The dominance analysis was conducted using custom MATLAB code, which was stored in the Code folder.
